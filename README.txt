Cooties is a participatory simulation, originally developed for PalmOS and is ported to Android by a group of students 
from University of Michigan enrolled in a senior level mobile app design course. 
Cooties’ purpose is to use near field communication (NFC) technology to model the spread of disease and help children 
learn how infectious diseases are transmitted from one to another and how thus how they spread. 
The students learn how diseases are spread by participating in a simulation of the spread of a disease 
– they learn-by-doing, not by listening and memorizing

Currently, Cooties simulates two broad types of infectious diseases:

1.	The first simulates a pathogen that is spread via direct contact—here when two people simulate a contact, this alone is capable of transmitting the agent from one person to the other. 
This is meant to model how certain sexually transmitted infections, such as HIV, are transmitted. 
For these pathogens that are spread directly, the pathogen spends no time in the environment; rather it is excreted from someone who is infectious directly to someone else's targets exposure site.
2.	The second simulates a pathogen that is spread via indirect contact. 
Here when two people simulate a contact, they are simulating skin to skin contact, where pathogen contamination on the skin of one, may be spread to the second person. 
Compared to the direct-contact model, the pathogens in this model are excreted to the environment—in this case the skin of people—transferred between people, and finally inoculated from the 
skin of a person to their own target site of exposure. 
For respiratory infectious such as influenza, pathogens are shed during coughs, sneezes, and when someone touches their runny nose; the target site of exposure for this example is the mucous 
membranes in the upper or lower respiratory tract. 
Besides respiratory infections, another example of infections spread through the environment are gastrointestinal infections, such as norovirus infection. Here pathogens are shed during defecation,
 and can similarly contaminate a person's hands. 
Inoculation here involves ingestion of the pathogens on the hands. 
This can happen when food is contaminated, but it can also happen when somone touches their hands to their mouth. Thus, both of these types of agents, respiratory and gastrointestinal, 
may be simulated in a similar fashion, involving pathogen shedding to the hands, transfer of pathogen contamination on the hands of people, and finaly inoculation of these pathogens to potentially initiate infection.
